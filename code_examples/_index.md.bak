The following code examples are intended to help participate in the challenge. These solutions provide a straightforward baseline and should help to prepare own solutions. They can also serve as a starting point for individual development, but a completely new design is possible and encouraged.
We provide code to generate sample data for the Challenge datasets:

## Preparation for Dataset 1 (LIDCI-IDRI)

We provide code to generate sample data for the Challenge datasets:

**Dataset 1**: [GitHub LIDCI-IDRI Data](https://github.com/XRad-Ulm/E2MIP_LIDCI-IDRI_data)

## Example images for Dataset 2: 
[GitHub Fetal Brain Segmentation](https://github.com/Faghihpirayesh/E2MIP_Challenge_FetalBrainSegmentation) Some example images are included in the baseline approach and can be used to get a feeling for the data.

## Baseline solutions for task 1 to task 3 

Furthermore, we provide baseline implementations for the Challenge tasks:

**Task 1**: [GitHub LIDCI-IDRI Classification](https://github.com/XRad-Ulm/E2MIP_LIDCI-IDRI_classification)

**Task 2**: [GitHub LIDCI-IDRI Segmentation](https://github.com/XRad-Ulm/E2MIP_LIDC-IDRI_segmentation)

**Task 3**: [GitHub Fetal Brain Segmentation](https://github.com/Faghihpirayesh/E2MIP_Challenge_FetalBrainSegmentation)

These solutions provide a straightforward baseline and should help to prepare own solutions. They can also serve as a starting point for individual development, but a completely new design is possible and encouraged.
