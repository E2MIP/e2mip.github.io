# Welcome to the E2MIP Challenge!

## Introduction

To combat the damaging effects of climate change, conserving energy is imperative. However, the increasing use of computational resources for medical image processing remains a concerning trend. That's where our international challenge comes in: We aim to cultivate and evaluate innovative solutions that prioritize energy-efficiency in the development and deployment of medical image processing algorithms, ultimately resulting in more sustainable and superior solutions.

This challenge centers on two vital tasks in medical image analysis: segmentation and classification. The goal isn't just to identify the most high-performing solution but also to consider energy consumption during data acquisition. We believe that the participants' discoveries will set a new standard for efficiency and inspire further advances across various domains.

We encourage all interested parties to subscribe to our newsletter to stay informed of any updates!

## Timeline

The challenge is currently open. 

Submission date is the 17th of September. Late submissions might be possible, but we cannot guarantee the execution of the submission.
